Simple django project to startup with a user flow that has an integrated Register functionality.

Into models, I implemented some User models from a python module , An abstract base class fully featured with User model
admin-compliant permissions.

Into serializers, I implemented types of fields with a create definition and validation password through simple 
statements like If, Raise and Return.

Into views, I implemented a simple post request from CRUD(CREATE,RETRIEVE,UPDATE,DELETE) logic for the user registration
with a statement Return within response.

Into url, I declared the path that this user registration will flow through.

```
Migrate the data into db and run the server.
